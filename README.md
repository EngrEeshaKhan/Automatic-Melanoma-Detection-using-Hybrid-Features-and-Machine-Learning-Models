## Project Overview
This project implements an automated melanoma detection system using:

- Hybrid feature extraction (HOG + LBP + Color + Shape)  
- Classical ML models (SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN)  
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices  

All code is located in:  
👉 **`Notebook/melanoma.py`**
